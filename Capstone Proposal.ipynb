    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Each year, billions of dollars enter the betting markets around the world, with the lion’s share being bet on football matches. Punters seek to find any information that can give them an edge against the ‘house’, and the source of this information can even be an octopus ‘predicting’ the results of the World Cup games (Remember Paul the Octopus?). Building a machine learning model that can predict the outcome of football games with a relatively high accuracy rate from the industry averages can prove to be a lucrative source of income.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsurprisingly, this lucrative business of making accurate projections of football games and trying to beat the odds is also an extremely difficult problem to solve. As we will see later in this proposal, probability outcome of results (home win, draw, away win) are fairly close to each other, complicating the process of making accurate predictions. On the other hand, ‘shocking’ results, where a weaker squad upsets expectations by winning against a much stronger team occur regularly, even in the entirety of a campaign - as in the 2015-16 English Premier League when Leicester City won the championship.\n"

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I will attempt the build several models that will make predictions for the outcome of football games in the English Premier League. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ulmer and Fernandez (2014) show in their report that the balanced distribution of outcomes means to high entropy. For instance, in the 2010-11 season, 35.5% home wins, 29% draws and 35.5% away wins, the entropy value was 0.72, close to the value of 1 that depicts pure randomness. This level of randomness creates a particularly difficult problem to solve for the classification models."

    "\n",
    "As each game has 3 possible outcomes (Home win, Draw, Away win) we need to employ multinomial classification algorithms to solve our problem of predicting the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "Tax and Joustra (2015) have an excellent paper where they build multinomial classification models to answer the same problem on Dutch football games in Eredivise. Their choice of models include Naive Bayes, multilayer perceptron and Random Forest. I will be following their steps, deviating only in the choice of the an additional ensemble model as I believe Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) can be a better choice than Random Forests. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) will also be employed for dimensionality reduction before Naive Bayes and Perceptron models. This is not required for XGBoost as it has an inbuilt feature selection method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the temporal nature of the data, cross validation will not be an appropriate technique to validate models. Instead, I will be using data from the 2015 and 2016 seasons to evaluate the models and 2017 and 2018 seasons to test them, while all seasons with complete data prior to 2015 will be used to train the models."

    "Ulmer and Fernandez (2014) try to solve the same problem using data from the seasons between 2002 and 2011 to train the model and the 2012 and 2013 seasons to test it. Their evaluation metric is the error rate on the test dataset, which is the percentage of incorrectly predicted outcomes. The lowest error rate they could achieve was was 48%, which means an accuracy score of 52%. This was achieved by a linear Stochastic Gradient Descent model where draws were not predicted. The second best Random Forest model, which actually predicted draws had an error rate of 50%. My aim in this work is to obtain a lower error rate than 48% (or a higher accuracy score than 52%). Both the linear SGD and Random Forest models will be employed as benchmarks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy score (or error rate) was the choice of evaluation metric for both studies that this project follows (Ulmer and Fernandez 2014, Tax and Joustra 2015). As the class variable is relatively balanced and the aim of the project is to predict the outcome correctly to increase betting profits, accuracy score becomes a useful evaluation metric for this work that is easy to interpret."

Numpy will be a useful library during the feature engineering.\n",

    "Extreme Gradient Boosting (xgboost)\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier data from the 2015 and 2016 seasons will be the validation set, 2017 and 2018 will be the test sets and seasons prior t0 2015 will be used to train these models. Accuracy score will be the main evaluation metric."
